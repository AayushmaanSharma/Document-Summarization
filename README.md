**📌 Project Overview**
This project is a document summarization tool that allows users to upload PDFs and query their content efficiently. It leverages FAISS for fast similarity search and Google Generative AI (Gemini API) for intelligent text summarization. The system extracts text using PyPDF2, processes it into vector embeddings, and enables users to retrieve summarized information via a Streamlit-based interface.

**🚀 Features**
PDF Upload & Text Extraction: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from PDFs.
Vector Search with FAISS: Converts text into embeddings for efficient retrieval.
Summarization with Gemini API: Generates concise and meaningful summaries.
User-friendly Streamlit UI: Provides an intuitive interface for interaction.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Python (Core development language)
PyPDF2 (Text extraction from PDFs)
FAISS (Efficient similarity search)
Google Gemini API (For generating summaries)
Streamlit (For building the web interface)
